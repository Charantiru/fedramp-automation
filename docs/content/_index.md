Using OSCAL to streamline and<br>
automate risk management processes
{{% /usa-hero %}}

{{% usa-tagline caption="Modernizing Security Assessments, System Authorizations, and Continuous Monitoring" %}}
OSCAL offers a number of benefits to streamlining and automating components of the authorization process. Below are just a few examples:

- **Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** are able to create their System Security Plans (SSPs) more rapidly and accurately, validating much of their content before submission to the government for review.
- **Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)** are able to automate the planning, execution, and reporting of cloud assessment activities.
- **Agencies** are able to expedite their reviews of the FedRAMP security authorization packages.
The FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) expects to be able to build tooling to further reduce the cost and improve the quality of security reviews.

# Use Information in OSCAL Formats

Control-based information expressed using OSCAL formats allows you to:

- Easily access control information from security and privacy control catalogs
- Establish and share machine-readable control baselines
- Maintain and share actionable, up-to-date information about how controls are implemented in your systems
- Automate the monitoring and assessment of your system control implementation effectiveness

If you are new to the OSCAL project, we provide [learning materials](learn/) for the project.
