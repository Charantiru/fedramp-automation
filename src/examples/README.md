# fedramp-automation usage examples

As a collection of validation rules for FedRAMP OSCAL documents, `fedramp-automation` is intended to be used by FedRAMP reviewers to ensure that the documents meet the requirements of the OSCAL standard with FedRAMP extensions. Additionally, validation rules can be integrated with third-party tools to ensure that documents meet FedRAMP requirements.

For the purposes of third-party integration, Schematron validation rules are provided in a compiled XSLT format. This repository includes several usage examples using appropriate Saxon XSLT libraries.
