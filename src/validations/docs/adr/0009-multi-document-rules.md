# 9. Multi-document validation rules

Date: 2021-09-02

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The ASAP Development Team has, through 10x phase 3 funding, engaged in the development of validation rules for FedRAMP OSCAL System Security Plan (SSP) documents. Subsequent effort will extend the coverage of validation rules to additional documents, including System Assessment Report (SAR), Security Assessment Plan (SAP), and Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) documents.

This extended rule coverage will entail decisions on the following:

- An manner of organizing rules for each document type
- A mechanism for evaluating cross-document validation rules

## Considerations

- Invasiveness on rule writing process
- Performance of rule evaluation
- Level-of-effort required for integrations (third-party and the ASAP UI)
- Ability of third-parties to augment the rule set with custom rules

## Decision

## Consequences
