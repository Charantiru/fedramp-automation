 - [ ] Code quality checks passed (*from [QASP](https://github.com/flexion/TTS-10x/wiki/TTS-QASP)*)

 - [ ] Code reviewed - Code reviewed by at least one other team members (or developed by a pair)
 - [ ] Source code merged - Code thatâ€™s demoed must be in source control and merged
 - [ ] Code must successfully build and deploy into staging environment (*from [QASP](https://github.com/flexion/TTS-10x/wiki/TTS-QASP)*): this may evolve from xslt sh pipline into something more
