A role with an ID value of "system-owner" is required. Use the responsible-party assembly to associate this role with the party assembly containing the System Owner's information.

**Preferred Approach**: When multiple parties share the same address, such as multiple staff members at a company HQ, define the ```location``` once as a location assembly, then use the ```location-uuid``` field within each ```party``` assembly to identify the location of that individual or team.

**Alternate Approach**: If the address is unique to this individual, it may be included in the ```party``` assembly itself.

**Hybrid Approach**: It is possible to include both a ```location-uuid``` and an ```address``` assembly within a ```party``` assembly. This may be used where multiple staff are in the same building, yet have different office numbers or mail stops. Use the ```location-uuid``` to identify the shared building, and only include a single ```addr-line``` field within the party's ```address``` assembly.

A tool developer may elect to always create a location assembly, even when only used once; however, tools must recognize and handle all of the approaches above when processing OSCAL files.
