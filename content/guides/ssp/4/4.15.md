IMPORTANT FOR LEVERAGED SYSTEMS: <br>
While a leveraged system has no need to represent content here, its SSP must include special inheritance and responsibility information in the individual controls. See Section 5.4.8, Response: Identifying Inheritable Controls and Customer Responsibilities for more information.
<br>
<br>
The description and remarks fields are Markup multiline, which enables the text to be formatted. This requires special handling. See Section 2.6 Handling OSCAL Data Types in the Guide to OSCAL-based FedRAMP Content, or visit:
https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/model-concepts/datatypes/#markup-multiline
<br><br>
The authorization-date field is string type date, which requires a four digit year, a dash, a two digit month, a dash, a two digit day, and an optional timezone offset. (yyyy-mm-dd or yyyy-mm-dd-05:00)
For more information, visit:
https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/model-concepts/datatypes/#date
<br><br>
Additional information is required within each control. See Section 5.4.9, Leveraged Authorization Response: Inheriting Controls, Satisfying Responsibilities for more information.

If this system is leveraging the authorization of one or more systems, such as a SaaS running on an IaaS, each leveraged system must be represented within the ```system-implementation``` assembly. There must be one ```leveraged-authorization``` assembly and one matching ```component``` assembly for each leveraged authorization.

The ```leveraged-authorization``` assembly includes the leveraged system's name, POC, and authorization date. The ```component``` assembly must be linked to the ```leveraged-authorization```  assembly using a property (```prop```) field with the name ```leveraged-authorization-uuid``` and the UUID value of its associated ```leveraged-authorization``` assembly. The ```component``` assembly enables controls to reference it with the ```by-component``` responses described in *Section 5.4, Control Implementation Descriptions**. The ```implementation-point``` property value must be set to "external".

Additional information is required within each control. See *Section 5.4.9, Leveraged Authorization Response: Inheriting Controls, Satisfying Responsibilities** for more information.

If the leveraged system owner provides a UUID for their system, such as in an OSCAL-based Inheritance and Responsibility document (similar to a CRM), it should be provided as the ```inherited-uuid property value```.
